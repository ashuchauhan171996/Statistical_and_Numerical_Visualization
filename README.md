# Statistical_and_Numerical_Visualization
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice in terms of creating standard statistical and numerical visualizations of data.

## Data:

You should use the WTA tennis dataset (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_wtaLinks to an external site.). You do not need to visualize the entire dataset as there is a large amount of data.  The visualizations you create will typically be of only a subset of the data.

 

## Code and Generating Visualizations:

Your homework project should be done in a coding language, not in a separate visualization tool/suite.  The choice of language (Python/Java/C++/Javascript/R/others) is up to you, however.  Furthermore, you are expected to use libraries to provide support for crating these visualizations; a list of such libraries is below.  You should write a program that will import the data and will generate visualizations from it as described below.  You may generate all visualizations via a single program, or may write separate programs to generate various visualizations.

 
 
To achieve a minimal A grade (of 90% at most), you will need to include at least 5 visualizations; the list to choose from is below.  Specifically you should include:

At least one showing distributions of a variable
At least three plots from the limited number of variables section. At least one of these should be from outside the pie/bar/line group (i.e. one should be from those listed as Population Pyramid and below in the list).
At least one from the plots of more variables
 

To achieve a grade above 90% (up to 100% maximum), you may include more examples from the list below.  In particular, each additional graph (beyond the first 5) will add points:

Plots of distributions of a variable: 2 points
Plots of limited number of variables for those in the pie/bar/line category: 2 points
Plots of limited number of variables for those after the pie/bar/line category: 3 points
Plots of more variables: 4 points
